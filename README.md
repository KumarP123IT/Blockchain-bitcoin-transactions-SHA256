# RealTime Bitcoin Transaction System with SHA256 Hashing

A simple and secure simulation of a Bitcoin-like blockchain system that allows users to process transactions in real-time. This project demonstrates the functionality of blockchain technology with SHA256 for hashing, including transaction creation, block mining, and blockchain validation.

## Features
- **User-initiated Transactions:** Allows users to enter sender and recipient details along with the transaction amount.
- **Blockchain Mining:** Each transaction is added to a new block which is mined using a proof-of-work mechanism.
- **SHA256 Hashing:** Uses the SHA256 algorithm to generate hashes for blocks and transactions, ensuring data integrity.
- **Blockchain Validation:** Verifies the integrity of the blockchain by checking the hash consistency and previous block references.
- **Transaction History:** Displays the blockchainâ€™s current state after each transaction, showing block details, hashes, and timestamps.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- **Java JDK (version 8 or above)**
- A basic understanding of blockchain concepts and SHA256 hashing
